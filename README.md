# Python_Advanced_Pandas_Features_3_Chicago_Religious_Trends

This project uses US county level census data on Religion to determine changes in population religiousness levels over 1980 to 2010. In particular, data for the five Chicago counties of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake and Will is considered along with State level and National level data.

The census data is taken from the Association of Religious Data Archives website. Links to the base data:
